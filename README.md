# Akan Web Application

### Author: Edward Koome

## Description

This is a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. 

## Instructions

To get your Akan name, access the site through this [link](koomea.github.io/akan-app/). Once on the site, enter your date of birth and select your gender then submit.
Your day of birth and your asigned Akan name will be displayed.
