            <p>
               The Akan naming System is a web application that is based on a Ghananian naming culture. <br> The Ghananian Akan naming works as follows;
               <p>Children are given their first names as a day name which corresponds to the day of the week they were born.</p>
            </p>

        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>
            The system takes your birthday(date of birth) and gives you the day 
            of the week you were born. At the same time it gives you an Akan name as per your day of birth.
